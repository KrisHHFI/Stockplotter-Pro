#  Stockplotter Pro
<br>

## About
- This program was a university project, created in the autumn of 2023.
- The user can search for stocks via Polygon.io. Stocks can be saved and examined. The user can also use a simple cork board, to plan their next market moves.
- The project was not continued after the course. However, the idea may be developed in a future project.
- Check out the [demo video](https://www.google.com/).
